# GPT from scratch

This is a collection of scripts exploring various aspects of autoregressive language modelling. Planned topics are:

- Basic reimplementation of GPT using a character level tokenizer, and training it on the simple 'tiny shakespeare' dataset
- Implementing a version of the GPT tokenizer and exploring tokenization schemes
- Some barebones reimplementation of RLHF

We're a ragtag set of individuals with limited GPU access so please don't penalise us for not being able to be fancy! ~ goodday
